# DataCamp Guided Projects

## Overview
This repository contains guided projects completed as part of DataCamp courses. Each project is designed to reinforce
the concepts covered in the respective courses and provide hands-on experience in applying data science and analytics skills.

## Structure
The repository is organized into folders, each corresponding to a specific guided project. The structure is as follows:

- **Investigating Netflix Movies**
  - `project1_notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for the first guided project.
  - `data/`: Folder containing any necessary datasets for the project.
  - `README.md`: Brief overview of the project, objectives, and any specific instructions.

- **Project: Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores**
  - `project2_notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for the second guided project.
  - `data/`: Data folder for the second project.
  - `README.md`: Summary of the project, key takeaways, and possible extensions.

...

## Usage
Feel free to explore each project folder to review the code, analysis, and results. The Jupyter Notebooks are well-commented and include explanations for each step. Additionally, you can run the notebooks locally by setting up a Python environment with the required dependencies mentioned in the course.
