# DataCamp Guided Projects

## Overview
This repository contains guided projects completed as part of DataCamp courses. Each project is designed to reinforce
the concepts covered in the respective courses and provide hands-on experience in applying data science and analytics skills.
The Files within the notebook have all the tasks required. I have added my own code, so it may not be 100% the soluntion to the DataCamp solution. 

## Structure
The repository is organized into folders, each corresponding to a specific guided project. The structure is as follows:

- **Investigating Netflix Movies**
  - `project1_notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for the first guided project.
  - `project1_netflix_data.csv`: Folder containing any necessary datasets for the project.

- **Project: Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores**
  - `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for the second guided project.
  - `project2_schools.csv`: Data folder for the second project.

- **Project: Cleaning Audible india data on Python**
  - `project3_notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for the thrid guided project.
  - `project3_audible_raw.csv`: Data folder for the thrid project.
  
- **Project: Analysing Google Sheets Data on Python**
   - `project4_notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for the fourth guided project.
   - `project4_ga_sample_data.csv`: Data for the fourth project.
     
- **Project: A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners**
  - `project5_notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for the fifth guided project.
  -  `project5_nobel.csv`: Data for the Fifth project
...
## Usage
Feel free to explore each project folder to review the code, analysis, and results. The Jupyter Notebooks are well-commented and include explanations for each step. Additionally, you can run the notebooks locally by setting up a Python environment with the required dependencies mentioned in the course.
