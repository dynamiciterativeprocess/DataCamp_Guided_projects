# DataCamp Guided Projects

## Overview
This repository contains guided projects completed as part of DataCamp courses. Each project is designed to reinforce
the concepts covered in the respective courses and provide hands-on experience in applying data science and analytics skills.

## Structure
The repository is organized into folders, each corresponding to a specific guided project. The structure is as follows:

- **Investigating Netflix Movies**
  - `project1_notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for the first guided project.

Additionally, you can run the notebooks locally by setting up a Python environment with the required dependencies mentioned in the course.
